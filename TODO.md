After 1.0:

* bugbear?
* hide section command
* match -e pattern -e pattern (hard to do with click while keeping arg)
* match-span -s ... -s ..s
* print last section without --failure if exec exits with non-zero (how?)
* option to turn off stderr dots for hidden sections
* read-cmd time (and maybe for each section?)
* collapse any repeated lines
* make dedupe_blank_lines optional
* runfilter "grep pattern" (exec sounds like a good name)
* short command aliases (four-letter ones)
* match/head/tail --repl spans of skipped lines with ... (match span already does this)
* section -s pattern section --include pattern (tried it, not necessarily better)
* a way to reuse pre-configured commands
