*This is my text munging tool. There are many like it, but this one is mine.*

**linesieve** is an unholy blend of `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`, 
with *very* specific features, born out of spite.

Features:

* line-oriented
* section-oriented
  * show only matching sections
  * show the failing section
* match/sub with the full power of [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
* chain filters into pipelines
* colors!
* TODO: specific filters

TODO: git example

TODO: ant example
